# css-resume
Pure CSS Resume and Cover Letter templates.

[css-resume](https://novacourtois.github.io/css-resume/) is the best thing to happen to resumes since that last good thing thing to happen to resumes. 

It even comes with a [cover letter](https://novacourtois.github.io/css-resume/letter.html).

## Inspiration

Making a new PDF any time you have to update your resume is the worst.

Now, you always have the latest version of my resume. Isn't that something?


## Built With

* Modern Web Standards

## Contributing

This has only been tested on Chrome v58 and will probably break if you poke at it too much (paper does that).
Feel free to send me some pull requests.
Help is definitely appreciated.

## Notes

This doesn't have to be "mobile-friendly"!
Resumes should only really be looked at on desktops.
