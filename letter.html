        Hi, Girls Who Code!


        I'm writing to express my interest in working with you as a Teaching Assistant.

        One of my passions in life is using technology to make a positive difference, and know I'd be in an environment where my work will make an impact to people.

        Most of my background in Computer Science is self-taught, working on various projects, and time I've spent in the industry. Some of it comes from the courses I took at The University of Texas. I am always working on new projects, learning new technologies and methodologies, and seeing how I can help.

        I'm currently working on an app called Queering The Map (https://www.queeringthemap.com/), redoing the UI, optimizing queries, and securing the application, after they were hacked.

        I also have quite a bit of robotics experience. During my time in RAS, UT's robotics group, I was elected webmaster, won 1st overall in an internal competition, started a multi-university competition currently its fifth year, mentored fellow students, and worked on various projects. I spent two summers volunteering in my high school robotics team's summer Lego League camp. While working with the Boys and Girls Club as a STEM Educator, I built various demo robots for classes and presentations.


        I live in Austin, and am interested in courses related to robotics, Scratch, or front-end development.
